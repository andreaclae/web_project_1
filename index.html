                Whether it's at school or university, the one thing no one ever
                teaches you is how to teach yourself. We often just end up
                drilling specific exercises and mindlessly memorizing
                information so that when exam time comes around, we pass the
                test. But once the test is over, that information has outlived
                its usefulness, and there's no guarantee that information will
                be retained. In the end, we're really just learning how to pass
                our tests.

                >
                does this approach of repetition and memorization help us truly
                understand the subject material? The academic consensus nowadays
                is that it doesn't. In fact, what's more important than any
                individual topic is knowing how to study, but for some reason,
                this point is often overlooked. So, what can we do to remedy
                this?

                Well, there are various techniques and exercises that can be

              <p class="two-columns__paragraph">
                Math didn't come naturally to Barbara in childhood. She thought
                of herself as a more of a humanities person, and not a brilliant
                one at that. With an eye to becoming a linguist, after school
                she enlisted in the army, who sent her to lear Russian. AFter
                several years of service, during which she rose to the rank of
                Captain, Barbara left the army and decided to study engineering.
                It was during this time that she developed her learning
                methodology as she was forced to reprogram her brain for a
                different kind of learning. It turns out that when something
                doesn't come naturally to you, having to work hard to gain the
                knowledge that other people may get at first glance gives you a
                deeper, more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.
