**Web Project 1 - Sprint 2**
**_By: Andrea Claeyssen_**

This is my first project where I have used HTML and CSS. I have utilized flex boxes, tables, z-index, animations, transitions, images, videos, and links.

After this is completed, I plan on utilizing this projects code to create a new page filled with personal things; something like an about me landing page, using the same type of things i have learned. I also plan on improving my project by adding more animations and transitions, specifically in the images and videos.
